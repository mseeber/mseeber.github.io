## Hello World!

Welcome to the spectral bird. This is the place for me to share things
that caught my eye, things I picked up along the road and found to be
interesting and maybe talk about things I am working on and have been
working on but especially a place to practice writing down and
communicating ideas.

}}){:style="float: right;margin-left: 1em;margin-top: 7px;max-width:50%"}
The name of this site is inspired by my glowing friend Gwendolyn the
owl, watching over my workplace at home and radiating that spectral
mystical glow all over the place and totally not by the fact that I
already owned that domain and had to do something useful with it.
Totally not!

Aside from occasional word puns and stupid jokes, maybe things here will
be enjoyable for others to read and maybe even educational. In any case
there is no and there will never be any kind of comment section for
others to post to on this site. If you would like to reach out to me,
take your time to find my mail address and send me a mail.

Best regards

Markus
