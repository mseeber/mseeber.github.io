### BEAST - Block Diagram Editing and Simulating Tool (student project)

A web based tool for students to build and simulate logic circuits.

The project started in early 2017 and entailed the whole process of
project planning, starting with an idea, creating a concept,
implementation, documentation and release.

As of October 2017, the tool can be accessed at [GOLDi
Labs](http://goldi-labs.net/BEAST.html) and is forther developed by some
of the students taking part in the original project.

The implementation is based on simcir.js by Kazuhiko Arase. During the
project, simcir.js was addapted to be integrated in a new web
application that provides loading and saving of circuits and complex
components.  Basic intrefaces for communication with external services
provoded by GOLDi Labs were provided and integration of BEAST into the
infrastructure of GOLDi Labs is currently (2017) an ongoing process.
Also additional components such as a rotary encoder have been
implemented.
